    "3. You can manage the Python packages.\n",
    "4. You learned how to interact with Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "5. You can also use Python to perform logical operations. \n",
    "6. You now come across int, float, complex, string, boolean data types in Python. "

    "3. Type *import antigravity* in the Ipython Shell, it will take you to xkcd and see the awesome Python. \n",

    "4. Launch a new Jupyter notebook server in a folder called \"excercis\" and create a new Python notebook with the name \"excercis_1\", then you can do the rest of the problems within this notebook. \n",

    "7. Compute the slope between the points $(3,4)$ and $(5,9)$. Recall that the slope between points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.\n",

    "10. A year is considered to be 365 days long. However, a more exact figure is 365.24 days. As a consequence, if we held to the standard 365-day year, we would gradually lose that fraction of the day over time, and seasons and other astronomical events would not occur as expected. A leap year is a year that has an extra day, February 29, to keep the timescale on track. Leap years occur on years that are exactly divisible by 4, unless it is exactly divisible by 100, unless it is divisible by 400. For example, the year 2004 is a leap year, the year 1900 is not a leap year, and the year 2000 is a leap year.<br>\n",
