    "One feature makes Python really great is the various packages/modules developed by the community. Most of the time, when you want to use some functions or algorithms, you will find there maybe already multiple packages from the community coded that for you, and all you need to do is to install the packages and use them in your code. Therefore, managing packages is one of the most important skills you need to learn to fully take advantage of Python. In this section, we will show you how to manage the packages in Python. "

    "## Managing packages using package managers\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of this book, we installed some packages using pip by typing *pip install package_name*. This is the most common and easy way these days to install Python packages. Pip is a package manager that automates the process of installing, updating, and removing the packages. It could install packages that published on [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/). When we installed the Miniconda installer, it also installed pip for you to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, you can use *pip help* to get help for different commands as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Pip_help](./images/01.03.01-pip_help.png \"The help document of pip\")\n",
    "\n",
    "But the most used commands usually include: the install, upgrade, and uninstall a package. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Install a package\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the latest version of package_name:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install package_name\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To install a specific version:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install package_name==1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pip will install the package as well as the dependencies for you to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upgrade a package\n",
    "\n",
    "To upgrade an installed package to the latest version from PyPI. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install --upgrade package_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "or simply\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -U package_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uninstall a package\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip uninstall package_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other useful commands\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some other useful commands that you usually use to get information about the installed packages. For example, if you want to get a list of all the installed packages, you can use the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip list\n",
    "```\n",
    "![Pip_list](./images/01.03.02-pip_list.png \"Using pip list to show all the packages installed on your machine\")\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know more about an installed package, such as the location of the package, the required dependencies, and so on, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip show package_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "![Pip_show](./images/01.03.03-pip_show.png \"Using pip show to get detailed information about a installed package\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other package managers, like conda that shipped with the Anaconda distribution, but for usage, it is similar to pip, therefore, we won't talk too much here, you can find more information by reading the [documentation](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html). \n"
