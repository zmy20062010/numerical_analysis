    "You have already used the IPython shell to run the code line by line. This is good, but if you have a more lines of codes and want to run it block by block and share it easily with others, the Ipython shell is not a good option. In this section, we will introduce another option - Jupyter notebook, that we will use for the rest of the book. From the [Jupyter notebook website](http://jupyter.org/):\n",

    "> The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.\n",

    "Jupyter notebook is running using your browser, it could run locally on your machine as a local server or remotely on a server. The reason it is called notebook is because it can contain live code, rich text elements such as equations, links, images, tables, and so on. Therefore, you could have a very nice notebook to describe your idea and the live code all in one document. Thus Jupyter notebook becomes really popular way to test ideas, writing blogs, papers and even books, for example, this book is written entirely within Jupyter notebook. Of course, it has many other advantages, and we will only cover the basics of the Jupyter notebook to get you started. "

This is essentially creating a local server to run in your browser. When you navigate to the browser, you will see a dashboard. In this dashboard, you can see some important features that labeled in red: you can see all the files in the current folder, show all the running notebooks, and create a new notebook or others such as text file, folder and a terminal. We can create a new Python notebook by selecting the Python 3, usually this is called Python kernel. You can use Jupyter to run some other kernels as well, for example, in the following figure, there are Bash and Julia kernels that you could run as a notebook, but you need to install them first. We will use the Python kernel, therefore, choose Python 3 kernel. \n",

The toolbar and menu is self-explanatory when you hover your cursor to the toolbar, it will show you the function of the tool and press the menu, it will show you the drop down list. The most important things to know the Jupyter notebook are the cells and the different types. In the notebook, a cell is a place where you can write your code or text in it, and run this cell to only execute code within this cell block. Two important cell types are code and markdown, the code cell is where you type your code and can run the code in it. The markdown cell is a place you can type the description in rich text format, see the following figure as an example. You can search for 'Markdown cheatsheet' to get a quick start with markdown. To run the code or renter the markdown in the notebook is simple, just press Shift + Enter.   \n",
