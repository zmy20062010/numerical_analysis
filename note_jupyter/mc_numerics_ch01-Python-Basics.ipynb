Pip is a package manager that automates the process of installing, updating, and removing the packages. It could install packages that published on [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/).

    "A **logical expression** is a statement that can either be true or false. For example, $a < b$ is a logical expression. It can be true or false depending on what values of $a$ and $b$ are given. Note that this differs from a **mathematical expression** which denotes a truth statement. In the previous example, the mathematical expression $a < b$ means that $a$ is less than $b$, and values of $a$ and $b$ where $a \\ge b$ are not permitted. Logical expressions form the basis of computing, so for the purposes of this book, all statements are assumed to be logical rather than mathematical unless otherwise indicated.\n",

This is a new data type we come across - **boolean**, which has the built-in values `True` and `False`. For the purpose of this book, \"True\" is equivalent to 1, and \"False\" is equivalent to 0. Distinguishing between the numbers 1 and 0 and the logical values \"True\" and \"False\" is beyond the scope of this book, but it is covered in more advanced books on computing. Logical expressions are used to pose questions to Python. For example, \"$3 < 4$\" is equivalent to, \"Is 3 less than 4?\" Since this statement is true, Python will compute it as 1. However, $3 > 4$ is false, therefore Python will compute it as 0.\n",

Leap years occur on years that are exactly divisible by 4, unless it is exactly divisible by 100, unless it is divisible by 400.
